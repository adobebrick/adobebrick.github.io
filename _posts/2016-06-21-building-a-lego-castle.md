Many Lego enthusiasts enjoy building castles.  Medieval themed MOCs are always popular, and many Lego sets have been based on castles or other medieval type structures.  Today we’ll be looking at ways to improve castles and make them look more realistic.

One of the things that can make a MOC stand out is attention to detail.  While it can be more time consuming, the little things that you include in your castle MOC- or in any MOC, for that matter- are the things that people will remember later on.  Take your time, try a few things, and if something doesn’t work, try something else.  The beautiful thing about Legos is that it’s easy to try something out and, if it doesn’t work, to try something else.

In the real world, castles don’t always have uniformly sized or colored bricks, so why should they all look the same in your MOC?  Use bricks of different shapes and sizes.  Include some plates as well and layer them for a more organic look.  Try to avoid a monochrome color scheme and vary the colors in your walls as well.

If you’ve got a lot of 1 x 2 modified bricks with the masonry profile, which are pictured below, this is an easy way to make your castle stand out.  But bricks like these are few and far between in sets, and gathering a large cache of them can be expensive.  So, what’s the best way to make use of a limited resource such as these?  Use them sparingly in your MOC, but use them in places where they’re sure to be noticed.  Then use bricks in a similar color range around them.  You want bricks like these to stand out, but not like a sore thumb.

If you’ve got arches, these are also a great feature to include in your MOC.  Arches can be used for doorways inside a castle.  They can also be used for gates, a portcullis, or a drawbridge on the exterior portion of the castle.  Arches can add a medieval feel to your MOC and can be one of those little details that will set your build apart from others.

Torches set into a wall are another nice touch to add to a castle.  Using some 1 x 1 bricks with a modified vertical clip will allow you to add torches to your castle, adding to the medieval feel.  A combination of bricks and rounded plates and with complementary textures and/or colors also adds to the look and feel of your MOC.

When building a castle, make sure to vary the pieces and the colors you use.  You want it to look and feel as realistic as possible, and mixing up what pieces you use will help you do that.  Don’t be afraid to experiment and try something new.  If you don’t like it, change it.
