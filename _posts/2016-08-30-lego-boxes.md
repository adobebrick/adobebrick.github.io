Today we’ll be looking at making gift boxes out of Legos.  We’ve made two kinds of boxes, one with a hinged lid and one with a sliding lid.  Both are attractive and easy to make and can add that personalized touch to gift-giving.  Have a look and see how we made them.

**Sliding Lid Box**

The first box we made was the one with the sliding lid.  This box can be made in 5-10 minutes and only takes a few parts.  One of the things we liked about this box was that it wasn’t immediately obvious that it’s a box: the sliding lid sits flush with the rest of the box, making for a smooth appearance.

To make this box, you’ll need the following pieces:

2 6 x 8 plates (base)
1 6 x 10 plate (lid)
17 2 x 4 smooth plates 
4 1 x 8 smooth plates
4 1 x 2 smooth plates
1 4 x 10 plate
1 2 x 6 brick
2 1 x 8 bricks
2 1 x 4 bricks
16 2 x 4 bricks

To build the box, place the 2 6 x 8 plates side by side, with the longer sides touching.  Then place 8 of the 2 x 4 bricks around the edges of the plates, connecting them together so that they form a wall around the outside of the plates.  Repeat with the next 8 2 x 4 bricks, offsetting them so that they do not form a seam with the lower row.  Then center the 2 x 6 brick on top of the second row so that it sits on one of the shorter sides.  Take the 1 x 4 bricks and the 1 x 8 bricks and place them on top of the longer sides so that they are on the outside edge.  This should leave an inner ledge in the box.  Place 2 of the 1 x 2 smooth plates and 2 of the 1 x 8 smooth plates along this inner ledge.  Put one of the 2 x 4 smooth plates on the inner ledge opposite the 2 x 6 brick, and line the floor of the box with 4 of the 2 x 4 smooth plates as well.  Take 7 of the 2 x 4 smooth plates and place them along the outer edge of the box so that the cover the inner ledge, creating a groove.

For the lid, take the 4 x 10 plate and put it on top of the 6 x 10 plate, leaving a ledge of 1 x 10 on either side.  Take the remaining 2 x 8 smooth plates and the 1 x 2 smooth plates and place them along this ledge.  Then place the last of the 2 x 4 smooth plates and cover the 4 x 10 plate with them.  At this point, you can slide the lid neatly and snugly into the groove in the box and you’re done.

**Hinged Box**

Hinged boxes are also nice and attractive ways to present gifts, and this little one is no exception.  Making this box also takes 5-10 minutes, and it’s attractive enough to keep around all the time.  You’ll need the following pieces to make this box:

1 6 x 6 plate
1 4 x 6 plate
1 1 x 4 smooth plate
5 2 x 4 smooth plates
4 1 x 6 bricks
3 1 x 4 bricks
4 1 x 6 plates
2 1 x 6 smooth plates
2 1 x 2 base hinge plates
2 2 x 2 hinge tops

With 2 of the 1 x 6 bricks and 2 of the 1 x 4 bricks, make a wall around the outside of the 6 x 6 plate.  Take the last 1 x 4 and 1 x 6 bricks and place a second layer on top of the first, making sure to offset the bricks to avoid creating seams in your wall.  The take the 2 1 x 2 base hinge plates and place them in the 1 x 4 gap left in the wall.  Then place 2 of the 1 x 6 plates and 1 of the 1 x 6 smooth plates and put them on top of the second layer so that they form a solid wall, then repeat the process on the opposite side.  Take the 1 x 4 smooth plate and place it opposite the 2 base hinge pieces.  To make the lid, take the 4 x 4 plate and put the 2 hinge tops underneath it, then put three of the 2 x 4 smooth plates on top of the plate.  Put the last two 2 x 4 smooth plates on the floor of the box and snap the hinge tops into the base hinge plates.  This completes the box.
