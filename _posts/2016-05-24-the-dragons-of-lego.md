Over the years, Lego has produced several sets that have dragons in them.  **The Hobbit** featured Smaug, one of the Castle sets had a red dragon, and this year, many of the Lego Elves sets have dragons as well.  Today we’ll look at some of these dragons and do a side-by-side comparison.

The first dragon is the red and black dragon from the Castle set.  Our daughter is a big fan of dragons, so this was a must-have set in our home.  This dragon has all the classic looks you expect when you think of a dragon: it’s long and lean, and it has a very definite sinister aura about it.  The neck is one long, serpentine piece and allows you to adjust the dragon’s head in reference to the neck and the neck in reference to the body.  The tail is made of three pieces, all of which are adjustable and allow you to give the dragon several different poses for the tail alone.  The body is all one piece, as are the arms and legs.  The wings, with their black and red bat motif, complete the picture of this dragon as a force to be reckoned with.

The red dragon can also be built quickly, as it only has a few parts.  In just a few minutes, you can go from some very specialized pieces to having a dragon that’s ready for your medieval- or fantasy-themed MOC, or just ready for play.  With the look and the ease of the build, we’ve always loved this dragon.

The Lego Friends dragons present an entirely different picture.  Rather than a sinister or menacing presence, these dragons come across as playful or friendly.  The two we have are the Lava Dragon and the Water Dragon.  Both are brightly colored and are accented with dark pink, have stickers designed to mimic tattoos, and the eyes have distinct eyelashes.  The red dragon has claws on its wings, where the Lego Elves dragons have gems, and they even have seats on their backs for riders and treasure chests.  But, most importantly, both have more parts and are more complicated to build than the classic dragon.

The body of a Lego Elves dragon is not one piece: it has to be built, as do the legs and arms.  It’s not a terribly in-depth build, but it is more involved than the red dragon.  They appear to have pads on the bottom of their paws.  Also, the Lego Elves dragons have more posable options.  They can sit or stand and move their heads to a greater degree, as seen in the picture below.

Another thing to note is the different sizes on the Lego Elves dragons.  The Lava Dragon is about the same size as the red dragon, but the Water Dragon is smaller, and could represent either a difference in age groups or gender.  The fact that sets marketed towards girls have a more complicated build is fantastic

We would love to see more dragons from Lego, be they the classic type or the Lego Elves kind.  If there was a way to come up with a nice hybrid of the two, something that looked a little more fierce and menacing that had a more complicated build, that would be wonderful.  And it would definitely get added to our dragon collection.
