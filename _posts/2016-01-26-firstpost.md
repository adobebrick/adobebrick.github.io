Welcome to the Adobe Brick blog!  This is the first post, so I wanted to say thanks for stopping by.  The primary purpose of this blog is to talk about things related to Legos.  Buying Legos, building with Legos, storing your Legos… well, you get the picture.  We love Legos so much so that <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/store.asp?p=AdobeBrick">we have a store on BrickLink</a>.  

Ideally, we’ll have something new up on a weekly basis.  The goal is for new content to be up on the site every Tuesday, barring holidays and the unexpected.  It may be about something we built, or something cool we saw elsewhere on the internet.  The goal is to always have something new for you on a weekly basis.

Thanks again for checking us out.  We’re looking forward to seeing you back next week!
