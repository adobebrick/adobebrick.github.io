This year marks the 50th anniversary of Star Trek, one of the most beloved science fiction franchises in existence.  This Friday, we get the latest in a series of thirteen movies, Star Trek Beyond, and we figured this would be a great time to explore some of the wonderful Star Trek MOCs made from Legos.

Clearly one of the most iconic images from the Star Trek universe is the Starship Enterprise from the original series that ran in the 1960’s.  From minibuilds using less than twenty pieces to behemoths of 18,000+ bricks, the Enterprise is a favorite for builders everywhere.  Here are a few examples we’ve found online that we really like.  This one comes to us from [The Brothers Brick]( http://www.brothers-brick.com/tag/star-trek/).

And this little guy can be found on [Instructables]( http://www.instructables.com/id/Mini-Lego-Starship-Enterprse/ ).  Isn’t is cute?

Not everyone wants to make the entire ship.  Sometimes, all you need or want is the Bridge.  Some great photos of a Star Trek Bridge MOC were posted to the [Brickset Forum]( http://bricksetforum.com/discussion/14663/the-brickset-builders-guild-share-your-mocs-here/p39), and we’d love to see this as an actual set.

Let’s not forget the extras.  Gear such as tricorders, phasers, and communicators are just as iconic as the ship itself.  Done correctly, you can even carry them around with you.  It’s hard to believe the ones pictured below are actually made out of Legos and not real props from the original series.

In the 1980’s, Star Trek made a return to the small screen with Star Trek: The Next Generation, which produced a whole new crop of Trekkies.  Here’s another MOC showing the Bridge of the Enterprise-D, which we found at [MOC Pages]( http://www.moc-pages.com/moc.php/373969).  Notice how the floor even slopes downwards, and how the viewscreen is another MOC.  This is a very well done build, and another one we’d buy if we could.

But the trek didn’t end with TNG.  In the 90’s, we got Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager.  While not as popular with builders, we still found some MOCs online, including a wonderful model of the DS9 itself.  The station had to be complicated to build, but this rendering still makes it look graceful.  The original image, along with a few others, can be found at [Hex Dimension]( http://hexdimension.com/2014/03/feature-5-awesome-lego-star-trek-creations/).

This incredible MOC of the Defiant from DS9 comes from [MOC Pages]( http://www.moc-pages.com/image_zoom.php?mocid=91030&id=/user_images/19176/1377999960m).

Also from [MOC Pages]( http://www.moc-pages.com/moc.php/65962), this build of the USS Voyager is also very well done.  These builds take a lot of time and are a labor of love.  And they’re awesome.

Last, but not least, we have a MOC from Star Trek: Enterprise, the last of the series that was also supposed to be a prequel to the original.  The original image is [here]( http://www.moc-pages.com/moc.php/136079).  And who knows?  You might see something like this in the near future…
