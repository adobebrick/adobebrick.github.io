We all know that Legos are wonderful building tools, and you can use them to create all kinds of cool and fantastic things.  But Legos can also be used to create art.  Indeed, there are some artists who work with Legos as their medium of expression.  Take a look and see what others, and you, can do with these versatile bricks.

Some people have used Legos to create unique wall art.  You can use them to make the initials of a person’s name and frame them.  Lego initials can personalize a room, or a work space, and make it uniquely your own.  They’re great for a child’s room, or even for your office.  You can vary the colors and the size of the bricks if you want, or you can go for the monochrome effect and get a more modern art feel for your space.  Try making some on your own, put them in a shadow box frame, and hang them up.  The possibilities are endless.

You can also use minifigs to create framed works, too.  Take a few of your favorite minifigs, put them on a larger plate, and use that as a frame backing.  Once again, you’d want to use a shadow box frame, because a shadow box will allow you to have a three dimensional piece you can hang and display.  This is also an attractive piece of Lego art that can be used to personalize a work or play space, and it also makes a cool present for the nerd/AFOL in your life.

Other artists have used Legos to create clocks, wall murals, or even to frame entire walls.  You can take the larger plates, create the art/mural that you want, and attach them to the wall.  Some people have even covered entire walls with large plates and let people add or move pieces as they see fit.  This then becomes an ever-changing, organic piece of art, and this works well in a child’s room, as it encourages them to create, explore, and play.  One group of office workers even went so far as to frame an entire wall in Legos, and the effect is creative and playful.  Try it for yourself and see what you can come up with.

No entry about Lego art would be complete without looking at Lego sculptures, such as the ones done by people like Nathan Sawaya, Sean Kenney, and Iain Heath.  Works like the ones these incredible brick artists produce take years to master, but we can all admire and appreciate the hard work and the skill that went into these creations.  You can use Legos to recreate famous works of art, pop icons, and to make original art as well.
