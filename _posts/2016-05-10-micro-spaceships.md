In **The Lego Movie**, all Benny wants to build is a spaceship.  There have been many Lego sets over the years that have featured spaceships, from the Star Wars branded sets all the way down to the sets that Lego has come up with on their own.  Spaceships are one of the most popular things to build, and this week we’ll look at micro spaceships.

Micro spaceships are popular right now because you can sit down and have a recognizable spaceship in a short amount of time with a minimum of parts.  You can design your own, or you can purchase sets that have spaceships in them.  Some of the new Star Wars sets are micro builds and feature a number of different ships to choose from.

Some of the unusual color schemes that you can find in the Lego Friends and Lego Elves sets can be readily adapted to building spaceships.  While many spaceships are typically done in shades of grey, there are some folks out there building their spaceships with pinks, purples, greens, blues, and even touches of gold or silver.  Be creative when you’re building spaceships.

Another plus on the micro side is if you’re doing an entire fleet or armada of ships, micro would be the way to go.  You can even take designs such as a cube, or the [Lego Sphere]( http://adobebrick.xyz/2016/04/19/how-to-build-a-lego-sphere/) we built last month and dress them up a little to make Borg ships.  Here we have a Borg Cube and a Borg Sphere.

Let your imagination guide you when you’re building spaceships.  Allow yourself to experiment with color and shape in your MOC.  A spaceship can be the old school flying saucer or it can be a shiny, sleek ship or it can be a beat-up rustbucket that’s seen better days.  Or it can look like a swan.  Do whatever you want.  Just be creative and have a good time doing it.
