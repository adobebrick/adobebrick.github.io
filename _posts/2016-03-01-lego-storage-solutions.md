Today, we’ll be talking about storage solutions for Legos.  Figuring out the best way to store your bricks can be challenging.  It’s easy to overbuy and purchase something that’s too big, or to buy something that can’t grow with you.  Finding the best fit for your needs, present and ongoing, is what we’re looking at this week.

When you’re getting ready to purchase storage for your bricks, there are two main questions you need to ask yourself first: who will be using the storage and how many pieces do you need to store.  If you’re buying no more than 500 pieces for younger children, odds are you can do with a single bin, which is the simplest way to store Legos.  You also want a bin with a lid that can be sealed into place to keep all the bricks together.

Once your collection for the younger set grows, you may want to move to a larger bin.  
If you’re looking at a single bin solution, you can probably get one in the same place you would purchase retail Legos.

However, if you’re purchasing storage for an older child or an adult, you may want to look at something with multiple compartments.  Lego sets have lots of small parts and pieces, and keeping track of all of them can be difficult if they’re all in one large bin.  Also, a large bin isn’t ideal for quickly finding a specific part.  Having a compartmentalized storage system is much better in these situations.  If you’re looking for storage for around 500 – 1500 bricks, look at something with at least 20 compartments.  

<a href="http://s63.photobucket.com/user/anellas/media/20160215_171917.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h144/anellas/20160215_171917.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo 20160215_171917.jpg"/></a>

The storage unit above has 30 drawers of varying sizes and can be wall mounted.  Having different sizes of drawers can be very helpful, as you may have a large number of some pieces or a lot of larger bricks that won’t fit in a smaller drawer.  You may find that you need more than one of these multiple drawer bins, and the fact that they can be wall mounted also saves space.  These kinds of storage solutions can be added to easily, which is another plus. 

Once you move past 1500 bricks or you’re doing lots of building, you can continue to add to units such as the one above, or even augment it with larger units.  A cabinet like the one below is ideal for this, as all of the ‘drawers’ are themselves smaller storage units with multiple compartments, so you can still store those rare pieces as well as a larger volume of the more common pieces.  This cabinet also works well for those who are selling Legos.

TIP: When you are selling bricks on a website like BrickLink, and you have a large number of bricks to sort, it can be very tempting to sort them by color.  It’s actually easier to sort them by part than by color.  The reason for this is that when your orders come in, they are listed by part number as well as color.  There are more unique part numbers than there are colors.  If your pieces are sorted by part number, you can go straight to that part and pick out the color your buyer has selected.  If you sort by color, it can be much harder to pick out an individual part.
