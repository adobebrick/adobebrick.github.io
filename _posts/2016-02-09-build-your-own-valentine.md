Welcome back to Adobe Brick!  Since this week is Valentine’s Day week, we’re building things in that theme: hearts and flowers.  Come on in and check it out!

#Hearts

When people think about Valentine’s Day, one of the first things they think of is the proverbial symbol of love: the heart.  Hearts are easy to build, and there are several different patterns available online, or you can design your own like we did.

For this one, we used the following bricks:

* 12 2 x 2 inverted slope bricks
* 10 2 x 2 slope bricks
* 9 2 x 2 bricks
* 8 2 x 4 bricks
* 6 2 x 3 bricks
* 2 2 x 2 tiles

#Flowers

This time of year, flowers are in high demand and their prices skyrocket.  Why go out and spend a lot of money on overpriced flowers that won’t last?  Build your own like we did!

The rose we built above is taken from a set of Lego instructions, which we modified.  The original build has a pot and we decided to forgo that portion.  We also changed the stem so that it uses 2 x 2 bricks.  You can see the original instructions below.
