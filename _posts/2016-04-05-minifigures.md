Lego minifigures, or minifigs, as they are popularly known, are one of the most popular Lego products.  Minifigs are so popular, they’re sold separately from sets in blind bags, and the arrival of new minifigs on the market is an eagerly anticipated event.  The rarest and most popular minifigs can also fetch a high price online.  This week, we’ll look at the wonderful and varied world of minifigs.

Minifigs first came on the market in 1978.  With their posable limbs and variety of facial expressions, they made the world of Lego much more accessible to Lego fans young and old.  Adding minifigs to a MOC can help set a scene, such as police for a city or pirates on a ship or beach.  Minifigs are highly customizable: you can remove parts and add new parts to create the minifig you want.  Some minifig heads have masculine features, such as moustaches, beards, or stubble, while female minifigs are shown wearing cosmetics.  A variety of hairstyles, helmets, and hats are also available, and there are numerous accessories to help you round out the appearance of the minifig.

Some minifigures are only available in the sets from their franchise, like the dwarves and hobbits that appear in Lord of the Rings, or any of the Star Wars characters.  In order to get these special minifigs, you have to buy the set, or go online and purchase them from Lego resellers separately.

Lego also releases specialty lines of minifigs from time to time.  So far, there have been two separate releases of Simpsons-themed minifigs, one release of minifigs from The Lego Movie, and there has also been one series devoted entirely to monsters.  These minifigs are highly prized and lots of fun to collect and to place in your MOCs.

With the release of the Friends and Elves sets, a different kind of minifig appeared on the scene.  These minifigs are larger than the regular minifigs, have less variety, and are designed to represent a character in the set.  So far, none of these larger minifigs have been released outside of sets,

No matter what you’re looking for, Lego has a minifig for you.  Be it a man in a gorilla suit, an elf in armor, a police officer on the beat, or just the average joe, there’s a minifig that will add to your MOC.  Or maybe even grace your desk at work.  Hours of fun can be had collecting minifigs, and it’s an activity both kids and adults can enjoy.
