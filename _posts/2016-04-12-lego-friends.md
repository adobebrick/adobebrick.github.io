In 2012, Lego introduced a new theme, the Lego Friends sets, which were designed with girls in mind.  Up until that time, boys made up the vast majority of Lego’s customers.  Since its entry into the marketplace, the Lego Friends sets have been a hit among with both girls and AFOL as well.  Today, we’ll look at some of the Friends sets and see what makes them so popular.

The Lego Friends world is set in the town of Heartlake City and follows the adventures of five friends: Andrea, Emma, Mia, Olivia and Stephanie.  Each of them has different and wide-ranging interests to appeal to a broad spectrum of girls.  Giving them names, as well as hobbies and pasttimes, makes them more like dolls rather than the typical minifig, and involving the child with the characters in the story is one of the ways Lego keeps kids coming back for more.

One of the differences that people notice with the Lego Friends sets are the minifigures.  As discussed last week, the minifigs in a Lego Friends set are slightly larger than the typical minifig.  They are also more doll-like in order to appeal to girls.  Their features are very detailed, down to lipstick and eye color, something not typically seen in a regular minifig.  Also, their legs do not move separately like other minifigs: they’re all one assembly.

Another one of the differences in the Lego Friends sets are the variety of colors.  Pinks and purples of all tones abound in these sets, and these colors are not found very frequently outside of the sets marketed to girls.  When these sets first came on the market, they were also highly sought after by AFOL because of these rare brick colors.  These colors are still uncommon outside of the Lego Friends (and Lego Elves) sets, but do occasionally appear in other products.

Lego Friends sets have a broad appeal to kids as well as adults.  Girls like them because of their character-based sets and doll-like minifigs.  AFOL enjoy the sets because you can get larger numbers of bricks in rare colors.  Of course, just because you give a girl a juice bar doesn’t mean she won’t build an awesome robot.
