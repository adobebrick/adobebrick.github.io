Lego has partnered with a number of franchises to produce some really nice sets and minifigures.  But sometimes, you’ve got to make your own.  This week, we’ve built a minifig of the Alien (or Xenomorph, if you prefer) from the popular Alien franchise, and we’re including instructions for how we did it.

<a href="http://s63.photobucket.com/user/anellas/media/20160426_131450.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h144/anellas/20160426_131450.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo 20160426_131450.jpg"/></a>

The first thing we did is build the head.  You’ll need the following pieces:

* 2 black 2 x 1 curved slopes with no studs (part number 11477)
* 1 black 1 x 4 plate (part number 3710)
* 1 black 1 x 2 plate (part number 3023)
* 1 black 1 x 3 plate (part number 3623)
* 1 black 1 x 1 round plate with straight side (part number 4073)
* 1 white 1 x 1 round plate with straight side (part number 4073)

Assemble them as shown below and this will make the head.  Even just a few pieces into this build, the iconic oblong shape of the Alien’s head is clearly recognizable.

Next you’ll want to move on to the torso of the Alien.  Below are the parts we used.

* 1 black 1 x 1 cone with top groove (part number 4589b)
* 1 black 1 x 1 modified brick with studs on 4 sides (part number 4733)
* 1 black small barb/helmet horn (part number 87747)
* 1 black 3L bar (part number 87994)
* 2 black mechanical arms, battle droid (part number 30377)

<a href="http://s63.photobucket.com/user/anellas/media/20160426_130814.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h144/anellas/20160426_130814.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo 20160426_130814.jpg"/></a>

Slide the bar into the 1 x 1 modified brick so that it creates an axle for the droid arms and attach them.  Then place the 1 x 1 cone on top of the modified brick, and insert the small barb into the back stud like shown.  This creates the torso, which is shown below.

Next, assemble the lower part of the body.  Here are the parts we used.

* 1 black 1 x 1 modified brick with studs on 4 sides (part number 4733)
* 1 black small barb/helmet horn (part number 87747)
* 1 black 3L bar (part number 87994)
* 2 black exo-force mechanical arms / Bionicle, thick support (part number 53989)
* 2 black 1 x 1 cones with top groove (part number 4589b)
* 2 black 1 x 2 plates (part number 3023)
* 2 black slopes 30 1 x 1 x 2/3 (part number 54200)
* 1 black dinosaur tail end section (part number 40379)
* 1 black 1 x 2 locking hinge plate with 2 fingers on end (part number 44302)

<a href="http://s63.photobucket.com/user/anellas/media/20160426_130548.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h144/anellas/20160426_130548.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo 20160426_130548.jpg"/></a>

Once again, slide the bar into the modified 1 x 1 brick to create an axle and place the small barb in the back of the brick.  To assemble the legs, take one of the Bionicle arms and one of the cones and fir the clamp into the smaller opening of the cone.  Then take the arm and slip it onto the bar and modified brick assembly.  Next, take one of the 1 x 2 plates and place one of the slopes on it, then take the plate and snap it to the cone.  This creates robust legs for the Alien.  For the tail, take the 1 x 2 locking hinge plate and insert the dinosaur tail in between the two fingers, then snap the plate onto the bottom of the modified brick.

Once you have everything assembled, your Alien is ready for action.  It’s a little larger than a minifig and it has to crouch down for balance, but it’s ready to go into your MOC.  If you make it, let us know what you think.  As always, feel free to modify it as needed.  We’ll be posting a few modifications we came up with as well throughout the week on [Twitter]( https://twitter.com/AdobeBrick ).  And more action shots will be on [Instagram]( https://www.instagram.com/adobe_brick/) as well.
