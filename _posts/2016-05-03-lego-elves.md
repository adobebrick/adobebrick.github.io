Building on the success of the Lego Friends sets, Lego launched a new theme, Lego Elves, in March 2015.  These sets were manufactured and marketed with the idea of creating further interest in Legos for young girls.  Thanks to their unusual pieces and rare colors, they have proved to be popular with children and adults alike.

The Lego Elves sets follow the adventures of the human girl Emily Jones in Elvendale, the magical world of Elves and Dragons.  Emily interacts primarily with four elves that each embody one of the four classic western elements: earth, wind, fire, and water.

Farran- who is the only main character who is male- is the earth elf, and his colors are greens and browns.  The wind elf is Aira and we see her primarily in white and shades of purple.  Azari, the darker skinned fire elf, favors hues of orange and pink.  Naida, the water elf, is depicted in cool tones of blue and aqua.

Like the Lego Friends sets, the minifigs in the Elves sets are larger than regular minifigs, are more doll-like, and they also come in flesh tones rather than the generic yellow.  Many of these minfigs also have a wide variety of hair colors, and some of the extra minifigs that come in this year’s sets have very interesting hair color combinations, such as light green and purple.  With their delicate features and unusual hair colors, the Lego Elves resemble characters out of Japanese Anime, which is another appealing factor in their favor.

Another one of the wonderful things about the Elves sets are the animals you get with them.  Each elf has an animal companion that comes with them.  Farran has a squirrel, Naida’s companion is a dolphin, Azari has a fox, and Aira is accompanied by a bird.  The sets for 2016 will feature adult dragons that are representative of each element.  These dragons are a little different in appearance than dragons we’ve previously seen in other Lego sets, but they are very colorful and attractive to young and older alike.

Like the Lego Friends sets, the Lego Elves sets have a wider variety of colors.  Some of the Lord of the Rings sets featured tree pieces in colors such as olive and dark red.  With the introduction of the Elves sets, you can also get them in colors such as pink, purple, lime green, and blue.  The Lego Elves sets not only have a wide selection of colors and parts, but they are also very attractive sets and are well put together.  These sets are designed for young girls with an eye for fantasy, but adults like the variety in the sets as well.
