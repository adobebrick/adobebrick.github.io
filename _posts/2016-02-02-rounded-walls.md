In this week’s post, we’ll look at two ways to build rounded walls with Legos.  Rounded walls can give your build a very polished look, and it can add the perfect touch to your scene.  Plus it’s unexpected: many people don’t think of curves when they think of Legos.  But it’s not that hard to do, as you’ll soon see.

# Bricks & Cylinders

The first technique we’ll look at uses 1 x 2 bricks and 1 x 1 cylinders.  First, you want to connect three of the 1 x 2 bricks, one on top of the other, offset by one stud, as seen below.

After you’ve connected your three 1 x 2 bricks, place a 1 x 1 cylinder on the empty stud.  Continue this pattern as you go, and you’ll see that it’s easy to curve the wall into a rounded shape.  You can make this a pretty tight curve, with a diameter of 10 studs.

This technique is great for building towers on castles, wells, silos, or wherever you want a rounded structure.  You can make the diameter larger if you want, but we’re using the smaller one to demonstrate the flexibility of this method.

# Bricks Only

If you don’t have any of the 1 x 1 cylinders or cones or you want a wall with a larger diameter, you can just use 1 x 2 bricks.  You’ll need a lot more bricks and you won’t have as tight of a curve to your wall.  Here’s an example of a circular wall built using only 1 x 2 bricks.  

<a href="http://s63.photobucket.com/user/anellas/media/20160202_125309.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h144/anellas/20160202_125309.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo 20160202_125309.jpg"/></a>

Like in the previous technique, you’ll need to offset your bricks by one stud on each row, but the effect can be very attractive.  When you start your build, don’t try to curve them at first.  You want to get about 30 bricks in each row before you begin the curve.   Just take both ends of your wall and bring them together.  Keep adding bricks in each row until you get to the point that you can connect both parts to make a circle.  The bricks have some flexibility in this arrangement, but not as much as in the previous technique.  This wall was constructed with 140 1 x 2 bricks, so make sure you’ve got plenty of bricks on hand when you use this method.
