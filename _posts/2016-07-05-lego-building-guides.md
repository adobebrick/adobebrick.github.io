Sometimes, when you’re just getting started building with Legos, you might see a really great MOC that someone’s done with a very intricate build, and you wonder, “How did they do that?”  There are books that give very detailed build instructions, or show you how to build basic machines using Technic pieces.  There are also websites that can help you along.  This week, we’ll look at a few of them.

When you’re just getting started, websites are probably the best way to learn how to build some of the more intricate things.  Besides being easily accessible, they’re free, easy to share with others, and often have instructions written by fellow AFOL which are clear and to the point.  One of our favorite sites is [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/), which has an entire section devoted just to Lego, which you can find [here]( http://www.instructables.com/tag/type-id/category-play/channel-lego/).

If books are more your thing, some of the ones we’ve found to be useful are the Lego Technic Idea Books by Yoshihito Isogawa.  There are three books in the series- Simple Machines, Wheeled Wonders, and Fantastic Contraptions- and all three present very useful ideas and ways to build progressively more complex machines using Lego Technic parts.  If you want to get a good feel for how machines work, these are the go to books you’ll need.  There aren’t many words, but there are lots of photos to help you learn and understand the concepts.

Another book we really like is Build Your Own Galaxy, The Big Unofficial Lego Builder’s Book.  This is a great book for the sci fi AFOL.  The instructions are written and visual, with official Lego part numbers for all the pieces you’ll need.  While this book is almost entirely devoted to Star Wars, there are some builds for Star Trek, Mecha, and there’s even a Colonial Viper from Battlestar Galactica.  It’s still worth your time to have a look at this book if you want to learn about building spaceships and giant robots.
