Whenever you decide to resell Legos, you have to consider several different factors.  You have to decide where you’re going to sell them, if you want to sell them outside of the country you live in, and which kinds of Legos you’re going to sell.  Do you want to sell only bricks, or just minifigs, or a combination of the two?  Do you want to sell entire sets and not even bother parting them out?  There’s a lot to consider, and we’ll go over the pros and cons of some of these in this week’s blog.

**New Vs. Used**

When we purchased our first resold Legos for our own personal use, we procured several collections of used bricks, with mixed results.  Some were in good shape and looked practically brand new, while others were sun-bleached, nicotine-stained, or looked like they had been chewed by an animal.   Needless to say, we swore off used bricks from that point forward and decided when we started reselling bricks that we would only sell new bricks from previously unopened sets.

**Bricks Vs. Minifigs**

Last year when we opened our store on Bricklink, we sold all parts, bricks as well as minifigs.  After a year of doing this, we have come to the conclusion that it’s much easier- and more profitable- to only sell minifigs.  Minifigs are much easier to package and ship, and they’re generally the first thing you sell out of, too.  Orders consisting of minifigs can be assembled quicker as well.  Plus, assembling orders with lots of bricks is much harder, and more time consuming, than assembling minifig orders.  If you want to also sell bricks, sell them in large lots.  Selling them individually is more trouble than it’s worth.

**Reseller Sites Vs. eBay**

Lots of people buy bricks off of eBay.  That’s where we got our selection of used bricks.  And eBay is a reputable place to buy bricks and minifigs.  The only issue is that it can be hard to find exactly what you’re looking for, and you often have to buy in large lots.  Reseller sites, such as BrickLink and BrickOwl, make it easier to shop for specific parts or minifigs.  You can find and buy 15 lavender colored Technic pieces without having to buy a large lot of pieces that you don’t necessarily want.  If you’re looking for something specific, buy from a reseller site.  If you’re looking to buy large lots of Legos, eBay is your best bet.
