One of the clever things you can do with Legos is make jewelry.  There are several different styles that you can make, but for this post, we’ll be looking at earrings made with 2 x 4 plates.  All you need is a drill with a small bit, some jump rings, French hook earrings, a pair of needle-nose pliers, and some Legos, and you’re ready to go.

The first thing you want to do is gather your Legos.  When we’ve made Lego earrings, we’ve made several at a time, which makes everything easier.  Some people have used 2 x 4 bricks or 2 x 2 bricks, but this requires drilling two holes and you have to get the spacing exactly right.  When you’re making earrings with 2 x 4 bricks, you only need to drill one hole, right in between two of the bumps, as seen in the picture below.

After you’ve drilled the holes, you want to attach the jump rings to the plates.  Use the pliers to open the jump rings up, then slip one end into the hole in the plate.  Once the plates and the jump rings are joined, slip the French hook wires on the jump rings.  Make sure you’ve got the French hooks placed so that the back of the hook points to the back of the plate, because you want to make sure the front of the plate faces the out.

These earrings can be worn as-is, or smaller Legos can be added to them as well to customize the look.  You can add 1 x 1 plates, 1 X 2 plates, sloped pieces, rounded plates… the possibilities are wide open.  In the pictures below, we added a set of light sabers to one pair of earrings, and placed different colored and different patterned plates on another to give you an idea of what can be done.
