Lego began producing minifigure-scaled Minecraft sets in 2014, and these have proved to be popular additions to the Lego catalog.  In March 2016, Lego released four new Minecraft sets.  We recently obtained one of these new releases, “The Iron Golem”, set number 21123-1.  “The Iron Golem” features Alex, the first official female Minecraft player skin.  This week, we’ll be reviewing “The Iron Golem”.

We purchased the set for our daughter, who not only loves Lego, but also loves Minecraft.  It’s good to see that both Lego and Minecraft realize part of their customer base is female and makes sure to include their interests when releasing new products.

This is a smaller set, with 208 pieces, and it’s easy to build fairly quickly.  The instructions are pretty straightforward, and we built the set in under 30 minutes.  Since Minecraft is an eight-bit game, most of the pieces you get with this set are the more traditional bricks, as well as lots of plates.  You get several characters/creatures, including the aforementioned Alex, the eponymous Iron Golem, as well as a zombie and a pig.

The scene is a fairly simple one as well: a zombie shows up and Alex uses a Jack O’Lantern to summon an Iron Golem to dispatch the zombie.  The Iron Golem is underneath one of the larger plates, and the use of hinges allows him to appear to come up out of the ground when spawned.

The hinges are pictured above, the arrival of the Iron Golem is shown below.

Lego is a natural for Minecraft building sets, as many have said that Minecraft is essentially a Lego-type game.  You have blocks and you build with them, only digitally.  You don’t need lots of special parts to build a scene from Minecraft using Legos.

All in all, we would recommend this set to someone looking to purchase a new set of Legos.  At $19.99US, it’s reasonably priced, you get several minifigs, it’s easy to build, and easy to expand.  Our daughter has already enjoyed many hours of play with this set and is eagerly anticipating adding more Minecraft sets to her personal collection.  This is sure to be a hit for the Lego or Minecraft fan in your life, and with the minifigs, can even be considered an investment opportunity for resellers.
