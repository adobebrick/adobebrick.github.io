This week, we’re going to look at building trees.  Be it a solitary tree in a city scene or one of many trees in a forest, trees can really make your MOC stand out and add an extra dimension to your build.  In this post, we’ll look at the basics of building trees.  Next week, we’ll get more specific.  Click on the link below, have a look at the pictures, and see if something inspires you.

The first thing we like to do is use a variety of parts in the ‘bark’ of trees.  The root system should be the broadest part of the tree until you get to the branches.  To help create this sturdy base, we use slopes of various heights and widths.  We like to use the following slopes:

* 2 x 1 x 3 
* 2 x 1 x 2 
* 2 x 1 
* 3 x 1 
* 2 x 2 (for larger trees)

If you have any 1 x 5 x 4 inverted arches, these are also really great to use, as these parts create long, curved roots and add lots of character to your tree.

You may also want to use more than one color for the bark on your trees.  Lighter and darker shades in the same color family mimic the look of trees in nature.  Sometimes, you do want to go with a single color, like we did below in our Athena MOC.  Using a variety of shapes in the ‘trunk’ of the tree- 1 x 2 bricks, 1 x 1 barrels, 2 x 1 x 3 and 2 x 1 x 2 slopes, and modified 1 x 2 logs- gives the tree a more realistic feel as well.  Experiment and see what works best for you.  Remember, if you don’t like it, you can always rebuild it.

Branches can be a challenge.  The best part to use for a tree branch is a 1 x 5 x 4 irregular arch with a reinforced underside, or you can also use a 1 x 3 x 2 arch.  Both are perfect, but you can’t pile them one on top of another without having a structure that’s too heavy to stay up without massive support of that’s too thick to be realistic.  As trees branch out, they taper off and get smaller and thinner.  You can have two arches next to one another, but we like to use 1 x 1 cylinders to offset one so they’re not on the same level, and we also like to place them so they form a 90 degree angle with one another.  You can use your arch as a base of support, but let the actual branching out be done by the leaves themselves.

Start with one of the large 6 x 5 plant leaves.  Then you can attach other leaves (either more of the 6 x 5 parts, or the smaller 4 x 3 plant leaves) to that section and build off of it.  To create layers in the canopy, attach some to the top of the base 6 x 5 part and other to the bottom.  You’ll end up with a nice layered effect that looks very natural.

Thanks again for stopping by today!  Next week, we’ll look a bit more at those plant leaves and how to get that seasonal feel in your MOC.  If you’ve got the tree building bug, you can always get parts at our [BrickLink]( http://www.bricklink.com/store.asp?p=AdobeBrick) store.  

Have a great week!
