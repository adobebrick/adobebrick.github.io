Welcome back to the Adobe Brick blog!  Last week, we looked at some of the [basics of tree building]( http://adobebrick.xyz/2016/02/16/building-trees/).  This week, we’re going a bit more in-depth and exploring a few of the more advanced things you can do with trees in your MOC.  Read on and get inspired!

Trees are a great way to convey seasons in your build.  For Spring, put some blossoms on your branches.  You want to space them out a bit and try to keep them in the same color family.  Different shades of pink are fine, but a single tree generally should not have both yellow and pink blossoms.  However, using multiple colors is a great way of showing different species of flowering trees.  Put one color on the first tree and use the other color on the second tree.  This effect is attractive and will draw people in to look at your MOC when you’ve got it on display.

For a summertime tree, remove the blossoms and add fruit to the branches.  Blossoms and fruit should not both appear on one tree at the same time, as the fruit on trees actually comes from fertilized blossoms.   Using the same tree as we did in the previous picture, we took off the flowers and put on the fruit.  It’s the same tree in both pictures: all we did was change what we had on the leaves.

Another way to add dimension to your trees is to vary the colors of the leaves.  There are several different shades of green to choose from, so a spring or summer tree can have variety even though all the branches are some shade of green.  Bright green can be used to show newer growth, whereas dark green would more closely resemble older leaves and branches.  Trees in autumn display beautiful shades of red, orange, and gold.  Try using some in your own MOC and see what a difference a splash of seasonal color can make.  Using the same tree as before, we removed the brighter greens leaves and replaced them with orange, red, and dark green leaves.  Each of these sets of leaves was accented with smaller olive green leaves, and the overall effect is one of a tree turning colors in the fall.

Leaves come in all sort of colors now, including some not normally seen in nature.  The Friends sets introduced us to pink and lime green, and the Elves sets have given us lavender, purple, and blue.  Some of the Disney Princess sets even have white leaves, which creates the effect of branches covered in snow and looks great in a winter themed MOC.  You can use these different hues to create trees to dot the landscape of an alien world, or to show trees that have been transformed by strange and bizarre magic.  

You can use things besides leaves in trees.  In the example below, our daughter used sea grass for moss and Bionicle spines for thorny vines, which created a spooky feel for her trees.  This was exactly the effect she was looking for, and this technique, combined with leaves in darker and muted tones, worked well in her MOC.

Be creative!  Don’t be afraid to experiment and try something new when you build a tree.  If it doesn’t work, take it apart and try something else.  Trees are extremely versatile and are a wonderful way to make use of your creativity and set your MOC apart.

Thanks again for stopping by, we do appreciate it.  Have a great week!
