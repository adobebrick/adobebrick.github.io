So you’ve scored a great deal on some used Legos on eBay.  They’re super rare, super cheap, and super dirty.  Maybe someone buried them, or spilled soda on them and never cleaned it up.  No matter, because this week, we’ll look at how to turn your tarnished bricks from trash back into treasure.

Hand-washing is usually the best method to use, especially if you have a lot of smaller parts to take care of.  It takes more time, but you know that each and every brick is clean.  Make sure you take everything apart and wash the Legos in lukewarm water and use a small amount of mild soap.  You don’t want to use water over 104F/40C, as Legos can be damaged by water beyond this temperature.  Just wash, rinse, and dry.

For Legos that need a bit more care, you may need to soak them overnight to help loosen up the dirt and grime.  You may also need to use a few tools to help you get some of the muck off your bricks.  Cotton swabs, toothpicks, a soft bristle toothbrush, and rubbing alcohol can help clean things up.

Toothbrushes are great for getting into nooks and crannies, but you want to make sure you don’t use them on delicate items, such as minfigs or decorated parts of bricks.  Use cotton swabs to clean these instead.  Dip them into water and use them to clean these surfaces.  For the really hard to reach spaces or detailed cleaning on undecorated bricks, use the toothpick.  Several photos of this process are below.

When using rubbing alcohol, make sure you don’t use it on a decorated portion of a brick, as the rubbing alcohol can sometimes react with the paint and destroy the decoration.  Also, rubbing alcohol can sometimes fade the colors on bricks, so use this with caution.  Never use fingernail polish remover (acetone) on bricks- this will damage the bricks.

Always make sure you rinse your bricks thoroughly after you wash them.  Place your cleaned bricks in a fine mesh strainer and rinse in cool water, making sure to gently agitate them so you rinse all sides.  When you’re done rinsing them, place the bricks in a salad spinner to remove the excess water.  Afterwards, pat the bricks off and place them on an absorbent surface to dry.  Leaving them to dry overnight is best.  If more drying time is needed, you can use a fan, but don't use a hair dryer.
