Taking pictures of your MOCs and minifigs can be fun, but it can also be challenging.  You can take great pictures of your Legos and you don’t need to spend a small fortune on camera equipment to do so.  Using the proper techniques, you can even take great pictures with the camera in your phone.  This week, we’ll look at two of our favorite techniques to use when photographing Legos, natural lighting and depth of field.

**Natural Lighting**

We have found that using natural light, and not using a flash of any kind, results in great pictures.  Since Legos are naturally shiny, when the flash hits the Legos, it can create a harsh glare on your MOC or minifig and ruin the photo.  Natural light can be tricky, and you need to look at the direction the light is coming from and where it casts shadows.  

We prefer taking pictures either early in the morning or just before sundown.  Pictures taken at these times take advantage of the lower angle of the sun in the sky and can create interesting effects with shadows.  Also, the quality of the sunlight isn’t as harsh, which helps to soften the effect of the photo, and is more aesthetically pleasing.

When weather is an issue and you’re stuck inside, you can still make use of natural light, provided it’s not too overcast or cloudy.  You just need a good window that gets plenty of sun.  Set up your minifigs or MOC and you’re good to go.

**Depth of Field Technique**

Using the depth of field technique is another way to add dimension to your photos and draw people in.  When you make use of depth of field, the camera focuses on one small area- usually your minifig or part of your MOC you want to highlight- and everything else in the picture is out-of-focus and becomes fuzzy and indistinct.  This technique draws the eye to the subject of your photo- the one thing that’s in focus.

The key to using depth of field to its best effect is to have a bit of distance between the subject of the photo and the background of the photo.  When we use depth of field, there’s usually about 6-12 inches between the subject and the background.  This way, the camera focuses on the foreground- which is where your subject should be- and the background images are out-of-focus.

Depth of field can be applied to MOCs as well as minifigs.  In the picture below, the tree we built was 6 inches behind the minifig.  We wanted to emphasize the minifig, but the backdrop of the tree added more dimension to the picture than just a plain, dark-colored background.

Try these techniques out for yourself and see what you can do.  Since most photos are digital these days, you can experiment and see what works best for you.
