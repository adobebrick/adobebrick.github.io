Many of us enjoy playing table top games with our friends and our families.  
Lego has had some table top games which allow you to not only enjoy quality time with your loved ones, but you also get to build with Legos as well.  This week, we’ll look at the world of Lego table top games.

Starting in 2009, Lego gave us games such as **Magikus** and **Minotaurus**.  In the game **Magikus**, the object was to assemble spell components, which consisted of several fairly common Lego parts, so that you could cast the magic spell.  The first person to cast the spell won the game.  This game was for 2 – 4 players and took 10 – 20 minutes to play.

In **Minotaurus**, the object is to get your three Spartan microfigures past the Minotaur and to the temple at the center of the maze.  You can place walls to block opponents as well.  **Minotaurus** was for 2 – 4 players.

In 2011, Lego introduced a new series of games called **Heroica**, which appealed to those of us that enjoy role-playing adventures.  There were several different games which were listed under the **Heroica** banner, and these games could be played individually or combined for a larger role-playing adventure.  In each of the games, 2 – 3 (and sometimes as many as 4) players were pitted against one another, as well as a group of monsters, and tried to collect a relic.  These games also used microfigures, and were a good way to introduce a younger child into the world of role-playing games.  Gameplay lasted for 10 – 20 minutes.

In 2013, Lego stopped production of Lego Games, so the only way to get them now is through online resellers.  You can find the instructions online.  Lego Games are fun for everyone in the family, easy to build, and provide quick gameplay.

Some people have continued to mix gameplay with Legos.  There are groups that play Dungeons and Dragons that use minifigures instead of the more traditional miniatures, because minifigs are movable and you can switch out weapons, armor, even clothing.  Steve Jackson Games, in conjunction with Crazy Bricks, also did a Kickstarter Lego board for the game Munchkin.  We’ve been lucky enough to see this setup twice in person now, and we’d love to have one of our own.
