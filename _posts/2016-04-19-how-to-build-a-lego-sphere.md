Welcome back to Adobe Brick!  One of the fun and interesting things about working with Legos is making something that most people think you can’t make.  This week, we decided to make spheres out of Legos.  How do you make a spherical object out of rectangular bricks?  Take a look and we’ll show you how it’s done!

As you may have noticed from the picture above, there’s more than one size sphere you can make.  Both of these spheres are fairly easy to make, they just take a little time and a lot of patience to put together.  In each case, the easiest way to look at this is that you’re assembling a cube and then rounding out the sides.  First we’ll look at constructing the smaller of the two spheres, which was designed by Lego artist [Bruce Lowell]( http://www.brucelowell.com/) and is called a Lowell sphere.

<a href="http://s63.photobucket.com/user/anellas/media/IMG_4359.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h144/anellas/IMG_4359.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo IMG_4359.jpg"/></a>

The construction of this sphere is pretty straightforward.  Here are the parts you’ll need, as well as the build instructions.

* 6 2 x 2 plates (part number 3022)
* 24 1 x 4 plates (part number 3710)
* 24 2420 2 x 2 Corner plates (part number 2420)
* 24 Modified 1 x 2 with 1 Stud with Groove (Jumper) plates (part number 3794b)
* 8 Modified 1 x 1 with Studs on Four Sides (part number 4733)

The tricky part is connecting the sides, which is done with the modified 1 x 1 bricks. You need a firm, yet gentle touch, and we have found it’s best to ease the sides together.  Apply too much force and the sides that are already attached fall off of the modified 1 x 1 brick.  It’s not hard to do, just tedious.  Expect to spend about half of your time connecting the sides.

The larger sphere we found on [Instuctables]( http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Lego-Ball/?ALLSTEPS).  You’ll need the following bricks to make this build:

* 24 1x1 plates (part number 3024)
* 12 1x4 plates (part number 3710)
* 18 2x2 plates (part number 3022)
* 30 2x6 plates (part number 3795)
* 6 2x8 plates (part number 3034)
* 6 4x4 plates (part number 3031)
* 8 1x4 bricks with knobs (part number 30414)

While this is a more complicated build, it’s still pretty easy, and getting the sides together is still the tricky part.  However, we were pretty happy with the results.

We’ve got more information about Lego Spheres on [Pinterest]( https://www.pinterest.com/adobebrick/), and proof that these spheres really roll on [Instagram]( https://www.instagram.com/adobe_brick/).  We really enjoyed this build, and we’ll be experimenting with it more throughout the week.  You can see those experiments on [Twitter]( https://twitter.com/AdobeBrick)
