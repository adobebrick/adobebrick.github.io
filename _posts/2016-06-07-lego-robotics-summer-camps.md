Now that school’s out for the summer, it’s time for many people to look at summer camps for their kids.   One that we’ve always liked and our child has always enjoyed is Lego Robotics.  Not only is it a chance for kids to build robots with Legos, but they also learn basic programming skills at the same time.  Lego Robotics camps offer kids the chance to learn while they do something fun.

Lego Robotics programs use Lego Mindstorms, which are kits designed to teach kids how to build and program.  The sets are not your typical Lego sets: they use technics parts, come with a programmable module (the EV3 Brick), and use motors and sensors.  The programs are written by dragging and dropping visual blocks of code that execute one particular task, such as “turn left”, “play a sound”, or “pause”.

Programming the older NXT blocks or the newer EV3 blocks is pretty easy to do out of the box, and you can have a functional robot built and programmed within a couple of hours.  Pictured below is one of the older NTX projects, Alpha Rex, a robot that walks.

In Lego Robotics camps, the kids will be given a task to complete by the end of camp, and they have to work together to get it done.  Sometimes, the task will also be relevant to the community, like how to boost recycling in the area or how to efficiently drain water to help prevent flooding.  This is a great way to get them interested not only in robotics, but it builds teamwork and an interest in the environment around them.  All in all, these camps are a win-win situation.

Outside of camp, one of the cool things you can build with Lego Mindstorms is the MindCuber, a robot that solves a Rubik’s Cube.  The instructions for building and programming the robot on the old NXT are available from Lego Mindstorms [here]( http://www.lego.com/en-gb/mindstorms/news/2012/april/have-your-own-robot-solve-a-rubiks-cube).  There’s something really wonderful about watching a child hand a mixed-up Rubik’s Cube to a robot they built and watching that robot solve the cube in a matter of moments.
