And now, for a little something about the people behind Adobe Brick (and why that name, anyway?)

[Adobe Brick](http://www.bricklink.com/store.asp?p=AdobeBrick) is a family-run store on BrickLink.  There are three of us: two AFOL and our nerdy offspring.  As you may have guessed, we really like Legos.  Whenever we're out and about, one of the first things we look for are the Legos.  Our daughter walks right past the Barbies and goes straight for the bricks.  When we were on vacation in New Mexico several years ago, we happened on a store that had a massive sale on Legos, and most of our personal stock of Legos came from there.  We bought so many we wondered where we were going to put our luggage.  That vacation was when we really got into Legos, and we've never looked back.

A few years later, when it came time to open our [BrickLink](http://www.bricklink.com/store.asp?p=AdobeBrick) store, we had to pick a name, and we decided to go back to how this all started.  Since New Mexico is famous for its Southwestern feel and adobe structures, the name was clear to us: 'Adobe' for New Mexico, and 'Brick' because Legos are bricks.  (So are Volvos, but that's another story.)

### Still wanna know more?

Sure.  We're nerds.  We like all kinds of science fiction and fantasy: Star Trek, Doctor Who, LOTR, Harry Potter...  We could go on, but we're sure you get the picture.  We love learning new things.  Sometimes, one of us even makes things.  You could buy some of them on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Anellas) and make us happy.

### Contact us!  And live long and prosper.
