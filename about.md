And now, for a little something about Adobe Brick (why that name, anyway?)

As you may have guessed, I like Legos.  My family and I love them!  Whenever we're out and about, one of the first things we look for are the Legos.  My daughter walks right past the Barbies and goes straight for the bricks.  When we were on vacation in New Mexico a few years back, we happened on a store that had a massive sale on Legos, and we stocked up.  We bought so many I was wondering where we were going to put our luggage.  We made it all fit, but it was tight.  And since New Mexico is famous for its Southwestern feel and adobe structures, the name for this blog (and our BrickLink store) was clear to us: 'Adobe' to honor New Mexico, and 'Brick' because Legos are bricks.  (So are Volvos, but that's another story.)

### Still wanna know more?

Sure.  I'm nerdy.  I like all kinds of science fiction and fantasy.  I'm a Trekkie, always have been, always will be.  I'm working on a math degree.  I like academia and learning new things.  Sometimes, I make things.  You could buy some of them and make me happy.
